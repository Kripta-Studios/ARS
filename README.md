# ARS (Aptitude Retrocompatibility System)

### What is ARS?

Aptitude Retrocompatibility System is an open-source project under the MPL 2.0 license that aims to solve the problem faced by many GNU / Linux system users who have great difficulty downloading, installing and running old software. ARS aims to fix this by creating a CLI (command line interface) application that downloads and installs a program with one command and runs that old program with another command. This program will bring back the retrocompatibility to GNU/Linux.

### The 3 main parts of ARS project

* **1.** Create an extensive database with hundreds of old programs. For ARS to contact the DB to know what procedure to follow to download that application.

* **2.** Create a set of mini emulators that contains the common characteristics necessary to be able to run an old program of a few specific years. And create the DB with which ARS will communicate to know what emulator to run that program with.

* **3.** Create all the infrastructure that will take care that the loclahost communicates with the DB of the programs when you want to install a program, and that it communicates with the DB of the information of the mini emulators to know with which to execute them and finally that everything That is done in the background, quickly, efficiently and above all without the user noticing. And create the CLI interface that will allow the user to type the necessary commands to download and run their old programs.

### Planification

This entire project in this month of August is still in the first phase of any project, the most complex phase, in which we think about how to do all of this in the most efficient and fast way possible. The development of the ARS project is expected to begin in 2021. It is expected to end at the end of 2022. But the time will always depend on the support of the community and the help of other developers, it is an open-source project all developers who want to collaborate with ideas, help or directly writing code are all Welcome.

In principle, the project is expected to be written mainly in C and C ++. And for Debian systems, although obviously it will try to create compilations for most Linux distributions. If the community considers the use of another programming language very necessary, it will be considered whether to use a language other than C and C ++.
